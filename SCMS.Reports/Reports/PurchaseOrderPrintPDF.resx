    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

No such conflicting, contrary or additional terms and conditions shall be deemed accepted by us unless and until we expressly confirm our acceptance in writing.

2.  SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY

Any inspection carried out by the DRC, or its representatives, or any waiver thereof shall not prejudice the implementation of other relevant provisions of this contract concerning obligations subscribed by the Supplier.

5. TITLE TO GOODS
5.1 All goods are delivered free of any third party's rights, and ownership of the goods passes to the DRC upon actual delivery at the place of delivery.

6.  REJECTION
6.1 In the case of goods purchased on the basis of specifications or samples or both, the DRC shall have the right to reject the goods or any part thereof if they do not conform with the specifications of the Contract in the opinion of the DRC or is not delivered in due time.

6.2 The DRC shall have the right to reject the goods in the event that the packing is not in accordance with the terms of the Contract.

6.3 When the goods or any part thereof have been rejected, the DRC shall have the right, without prejudice to the provisions of Article 9, to demand from the Supplier the immediate delivery of acceptable goods in replacement thereof in accordance with the contract or to purchase other similar goods elsewhere and to claim from the Supplier the amount of loss or damages sustained by reason of the default.

6.4 Goods or any part thereof in the DRC's possession which have been rejected by the DRC must be removed at the Supplier's expense within such period as the DRC may specify in its notice of rejection. 

6.5 After such notice has been dispatched to the Supplier, the goods or any part thereof will be held at the latter's risk. Should the Supplier fail to remove the goods as required by the notice of rejection, the DRC may dispose of them, without any liability to the Supplier whatsoever, in such manner as it deems fit

7. WARRANTY
7.1 The Supplier warrants upon delivery and for a period of twenty four (24) months from the date of delivery that goods purchased under this Contract will conform in all material aspects to the applicable manufacturer's specifications for such goods and will be free from material defects in workmanship, material and design under normal use. The warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse, negligent handling, lack of reasonable maintenance and care, accident or abuse by anyone other than the Supplier.

8.  PAYMENT

9.  DEFAULT
9.1 In case the Supplier fails to comply with any term of the Contract, including but not limited to failure or refusal to make deliveries within the time limit specified, he shall be liable for all damages sustained by the DRC, and the DRC may procure the goods from other sources and hold the Supplier responsible for any excess cost occasioned thereby.  The DRC may collect damages from the Supplier in lieu of purchasing the goods from other sources.  The DRC may by written notice terminate the right of the Supplier to proceed with deliveries or such part or parts thereof as to which there has been default, or if any delivery is late, the DRC may cancel such delivery or the entire Contract.

10.  WAIVER
10.1 No waiver of any breach of the Contract shall be held to be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach.  All remedies afforded in the Contract shall be taken and construed as cumulative, i.e., in addition to every other remedy provided herein or by law.

    <value>11.  CANCELLATION DUE TO EVENTS OF FORCE MAJEURE
11.1 The DRC shall have the right to cancel the Contract or any of the provisions thereof at any time in accordance with the provisions of Article 16. In this event the Supplier may charge the DRC reasonable costs of expenses incurred by him until the time of such cancellation which will only be paid upon production by the Supplier of supporting documents to the satisfaction of the DRC.

11.2 Should delivery to the DRC be prevented by prohibition of export or import, blockade, war, armed conflict, civil disturbance, industrial disturbance or other similar cause beyond the control of either party, the Contract or the then unfulfilled part thereof may be cancelled at the discretion of the DRC.

12.  BANK GUARANTEE
12.1 When specifically requested by the DRC, a bank guarantee from a well reputed bank acceptable to the DRC in the currency in which the Contract is payable and for an amount to be prescribed by the DRC shall be obtained by the Supplier at his expense and deposited with the DRC before conclusion of the Contract.  In the event of any loss, damage and/or extra costs incurred by the DRC by reason of the Supplier's default, negligence or failure to perform the terms and conditions of the Contract or any part thereof, that part of any such loss, damage and/or extra costs which is represented by the full or by any lesser amount of such guarantee shall be immediately and initially reimbursable to the DRC from such guarantee without prejudice to its right to hold the Supplier liable for the full amount of such loss, damage and/or extra cost. The guarantee shall be valid for a period of not less than 30 days after the date of arrival at destination of the last specified delivery.

13.  ADVERTISING
